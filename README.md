## Algorithms Implemented

### Divide and Conquer

-   Minimum and maximum value in an array
-   Quick sort

### Greedy Algorithms

-   Fractional Knapsack

## Installation and Testing

To test and modify algorithms implemented in this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/https://github.com/GECI-IT-2020-24/Algorithm-Analysis-and-Design-AAD
    ```

2. compile and run the tests in each folder using
    ```bash
       chmod +x ./test.sh
       ./test.sh
    ```
3. currently used c compiler is [clang](https://clang.llvm.org/) and linker is [mold](https://github.com/rui314/mold).Change the compiler and linker in makefile.
